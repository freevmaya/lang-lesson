We have received many stories and are working on animating them! \n\n❀ A PROFESSIONAL Voice Actor will record your story! We do everything to keep your identity private, unless you wish differently!\n\nHey people! My name is Joshua. My best friend, Bill, passed away last year due to a rare disease. Although we all were really depressed, but it was expected since we saw his health deteriorate each passing month. He was my best friend, I was really sad but I kept on laughing at his funeral and people didn't know why! Everyone just glared at me with weird eyes. You guys must be wondering the same thing, well let me explain…\n\nSo at the funeral, I was given a letter by Bill’s brother. It was his last message that he wanted the world to know through me. As soon as I started reading the letter, I burst into laughter! People were staring at me and I was aware of it but I couldn't hold it in….\nSo the letter said “Hey Josh, it's going to be a long time no see, brother. You know I was always a call person and writing long messages was never my cup of tea but well? Can't call can I?!”\n\nguys,This was the moment that I started laughing like an idiot because it's true, he found writing stuff VERY irritating. \n\nThe letter further said  “Remember the time when Mr. Williams lost our exam papers last semester? Well the truth is, I stole them! HAHAHAHA!”\n\nWell before moving forward let me quickly tell you about what happened. Mr William is our Computer Programming Professor and he is one of the most feared professor's of our university. We had our final exam paper which somehow got lost. Mr William had no clue where the papers went missing. Quite frankly, all of us were left dumbfounded because none of us had ever heard about anything like this. Mr William had to do something so we were given marks according to our semester performances and the entire class was quite pleased with it because the exam was scary as hell! One thing you guys should know is that Mr Williams has a strange addiction to Energy drinks!\n\nOkay back to the letter “My exam went really bad and I remember Mr Williams telling us that no matter what happens, if any of you did poor in your paper… Nothing's going to stop me from giving you guys an F grade and ruining your futures !! Since I did not do well on the test i knew doom was inevitable but you know brother.. desperate times, desperate measures. I was aware of the fact that Mr William is lactose intolerant so the next day I secretly slipped in some milk powder in his energy drink early in the morning. Being a lactose intolerant myself, I knew he’s going to get hit with the ‘Nature's call’ with in 30 minutes! I constantly kept peeking in his office and I've got to tell you, his expressions were  hilarious!! I laughed so hard that my stomach started hurting. He fought well but then the control went beyond his control, he had to rush to the restroom. As soon as he left his office, I went in, stole the papers and fled within seconds! GENIUS RIGHT? You guys can thank me now since I am that mysterious savior!! As for the papers, they're kept safely under my bed! Go ahead Mr Williams, you can now ruin my future but guess what? The joke’s on you because I don't have one! LOL!! I also switched my answer sheet so better luck finding the original one. When I cheat, I make sure I do it perfectly. “\n\nThe letter ended with him saying “ I don't have any grudge against Mr Williams, I hope he's present at my funeral. I want to tell him that I love him and I've alway been the naughty one so this was my final attempt at teasing him. Enjoy your lives everyone, life is short. Make the most of it! This is my final Good bye to you all! Take care.. Love, Billy Brooks!”\n\nI kept looking at the letter thinking that this amazing guy is no longer with us. The tears started to roll down my cheeks. \n\nLater everyone found out the reason I was laughing. Everyone laughed along INCLUDING MR WILLIAMS. He was present there, smiling with tears in his eyes. Upon his request, we found the papers and gave them to him the next day. He checked Bill’s paper and gave him an A!\n\nCredits:\nMusic: http://www.epidemicsound.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwg9ZWkKoEI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwg9ZWkKoEI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwg9ZWkKoEI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwg9ZWkKoEI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwg9ZWkKoEI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"My Story Animated","tags":["short stories","story","animation short film","animation","problems","stories","storytime","true stories","friends","myth","sociology","unusual","busted","mythbusting","weird","lifestyle","help","struggle","girl","school","my story animated","flirt","embarrassing","high school","teacher","funeral","secret","reveal"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"I Revealed My Friend Secret And Everyone Burst Into Laughter","description":"I Burst Into Laughter During My Best Friend’s Funeral And Revealed His Secret\n\n❀ Thank you for your constant support and engagement!
