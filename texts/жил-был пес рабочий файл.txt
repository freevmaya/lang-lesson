His hearing was giving out, and his sense of smell wasn't what it used to be. So he got the boot and was sent to fend for himself. This proved an uneasy task indeed. After much trying and eventually giving up, he met with an old adversary, the wolf, who offered to help the dog out of his lurch. Together they thought up a plan of how to get the dog back into his masters' good graces.
